I am going to use a dataset of an ancient book of wisdom, Thirukkural from kaggle.com. The original text was written in Tamil language. The dataset contains its English translation.  
I chose this dataset for Text Mining because this book has around 1330 set of poems and so this algorithm will reveal the most used words.
After installing the packages, I have loaded the data and then setup the corpus
Also, cleaned the data and created the matrix
Generated the most frequest used words
translation         men        will         man        love        gain 
       1330         254         145         103         102          99 
and word cloud of it.
